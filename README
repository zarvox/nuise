This is NUIse, a proof-of-concept driver for the NUI Audio device in the Microsoft Kinect.

You must provide your own copy of the NUI Audio firmware, audios.bin.  Place it in this folder.  See
http://groups.google.com/group/openkinect/browse_thread/thread/17d96d9c36e3effc/df0a76abb4fd8414

Simply run "make" to compile, then "./nuise".  Press Ctrl-C to stop recording.

NUIse dumps the four microphone streams to channel{1,2,3,4}.dat and whatever
noise-cancelled data may exist to cancelled.dat.  To process these raw dumps
into WAV files which you can play back in the audio player of your choice, run
"make wav" or "python convert.py"

This driver still leaves much to be desired (which is a nice way of saying it's
a terribly mess), but hopefully illustrates how to interact with the NUI Audio
device.

Happy hacking!
